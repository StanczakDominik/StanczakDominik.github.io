<p>I'm giving a presentation on this less-than-glorious subject on Friday, so
I figured, hey, it might be a nice time to write a summary of what <a href="https://github.com/StanczakDominik/PythonPIC">that old
repository on my GitHub page</a> is. In a single video:</p>
<p></p>

<p>Admittedly, this post is going to be rather personal - this messy little code
was basically my life for a few hundreds of hours.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>The motivation</h3>
<p>At the time, I was quite enamored with Python, NumPy, the ideals of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886731/">open
source scientific software</a> and literate computing. I had seen
how most scientific software seems to be written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">uglier</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">less maintainable</a> languages and thoroughly disliked the notion that
We, the Scientific Community would have to keep struggling with those, <a href="https://youtu.be/kNdp0I8AG40?t=45"><em>no no
no</em></a>.</p>
<p>So I figured, hey, I can probably do better. <em>I know NumPY! It's basically
writing FORTRAN without ever touching FORTRAN!</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>narrator voice: <strong>It isn't.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I went to the amazing Sławomir Jabłoński of <a href="http://www.ifpilm.pl/en">IPPLM</a> (to whom,
a shout out, for he is truly an amazing person without whom this work would
have gone nowhere). I discussed the idea with him and he seemed to like it. He
agreed to supervise me on this idea.</p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<h3>The breakdown</h3>
<p>Well, stuff happened, not least important of which was procrastination on
a scale I had never performed. One of my personal flaws is a tendency to
isolate myself and work alone on projects that are better undertaken in groups.
I basically started writing a framework, refactoring it endlessly, delaying
work on the critical bugs like the actual physics of my simulation, running
test cases... What I had thought would have been simple turned out not to be.
Don't get me wrong, I learned a metric ton of Python and numerics knowledge
- but I wasn't getting much closer, and I wasn't reaching out for feedback that
what I was doing was, pretty much, crap.</p>
<p>I <em>may</em> have had a <abbr title="narrator: It wasn't.">tiny</abbr> nervous
breakdown then. Eventually I reached out again to IPPLM and mr. Jabłoński, who
agreed the situation is pretty bad but didn't think it worth giving up on. The
code ended up working after many adventures:</p>

</code></pre>


<p>and I was able to benchmark it nicely.</p>
<p><img alt="Python runtimes" src="../../images/speed_Python.svg"></p>
<h3>The benchmarking</h3>
<p>I then - only then, certainly a failure of foresight on my part - realized that
I would need a comparable C/C++ code to benchmark my Python NumPy monstrosity
against. That was not a happy thought. </p>
<p>But there was no way the low level drudgery could be avoided, so I went ahead,
started learning <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">the Eigen3 linear algebra library that has many similarities
to NumPy</a> - I needed something that in principle could work
similarly, with mostly whole array based computations. The result of that is in
<a href="https://github.com/StanczakDominik/CPIC">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, to this day I'm not even one hundred percent sure it does the same
thing! The results seemed to be correct for the test cases I did run, but I'm
not exactly sure I got all of the bugs. Most of the problems stem from the fact
I used <code>numpy.bincount</code> for most of the current and charge deposition
functionality (don't do that, by the way, as that was the least efficient part
of the code). That functionality is lacking in Eigen (or at the very least
I was unable to find it), so I went ahead and implemented it by hand.</p>
<p>I then started benchmarking the two codes for identical initial conditions, and
it turned out that - </p>
<p><img alt="Python vs C" src="../../images/speed_Python_C.svg"></p>
<p>success! PythonPIC is just as fast as the compiled C version!</p>
<p>... until you compile the C code with <code>-O</code>, the simplest optimization flag:</p>
<p><img alt="Python vs any kind of optimized C" src="../../images/speed_Python_C_C-O.svg"></p>
<p>I didn't bother checking <code>-O3</code>, though a friend was happy to remind me of its
existence. I might thus be the <abbr title="narrator: He isn't.">proud</abbr>
author of the cleanest (well, not the least clean) and least efficient
particle-in-cell code on the planet. Gotta start somewhere, right?</p>
<h3>The defense</h3>
<p>There's not much to say. I went ahead, printed out a few copies of the thesis,
realized via review I had made mistakes in plots etc. and had to print them out
again. I went ahead, took my final exam, didn't get grilled too hard, got
a random exam question about - I think, as it's been a while - the Schroedinger
equation, and poof, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8hvyjZWHs">trust me, I'm an
engineer</a> of Applied
Physics. I'm still not sure how that happened.</p>
<p>I took a break from PIC codes for a while afterwards. A snippet of PythonPIC
later went into <a href="https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/54">PlasmaPy's</a>
particle stepper capabilities. I still have a thorough dislike for that code
and think it could be optimized.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm not sure about Python for PICs. On the one hand, they're pretty
inevitably going to be slower than C, C++ for now. You could write the
computationally intensive parts in Julia or something - that would probably
work and I've been itching to try my hand at that recently - but by that logic,
you could probably implement the whole thing in Julia anyway, because Python
really isn't giving you anything of value there - maybe besides analysis, but
that's done post-run anyway.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, not all PICs are HPiCs - and if you're just studying
plasma physics alongside, say, <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Plasma-Physics-via-Computer-Simulation/Birdsall-Langdon/p/book/9780750310253">Birdsall and
Langdon</a>,
then you can probably live with having your code run a little slower than the
sickest optimal C run time. I've been able to use my code (mostly before the
break... remember the part where I was adding a ton of test cases?) to
reproduce a bunch of their results and it's worked out nicely.</p>
<p>I'd like to think PythonPIC has, thus, at least some value and use. It's probably
not too useful for high performance and research, but you need to funnel people into those
somehow.</p>
<h2>The lessons learned</h2>
<h4>Focus on the physics</h4>
<p>No matter how beautiful and readable your code is, if it doesn't do what it's supposed to be doing, it isn't worth a dime.</p>
<h4>Precrastinate</h4>
<p>I've once heard a summary of estimating time for completing programming projects (unfortunately I haven't been able to find the source):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for any programming problem, make an estimate, double it, then increment the time unit to the next higher one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth starting your stuff early...</p>
<h4>Plan ahead and anticipate issues</h4>
<p>... this part tells you how early to start. Still, unexpected difficulties will
inevitably happen - they're part of the learning process. Accept them and leave
yourself enough time to deal with them constructively.</p>
<h4>Reach out and talk about your problems</h4>
<p>This goes both for scientific programming and for mental health. I would have
truly gotten nowhere if I hadn't had help from amazing people for both of
these.</p>
<hr>
<p>And... that's about it! Phew. That's a load off my chest, to be frank - the
idea of writing this has haunted me for a while. Still, while the handling
could have been better, <abbr title="narrator: He is.">I'm happy I wrote that little code.</abbr></p>
