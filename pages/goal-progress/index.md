The following plots are generated via [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/), which is an awesome service. The idea is that if I mess up and don't keep up doing whatever I commit to,
I pay up to $5. It's non-inutitive, but quite neat.

# Work hours tracked on Toggl

This plot tracks all the time I spend (as tracked on
[Toggl](https://toggl.com/) on studying for university, improving my own
skills, open-source contributions and just plain old work stuff.

This one tracks all the non-recurring tasks I complete on [Todoist](https://todoist.com).
